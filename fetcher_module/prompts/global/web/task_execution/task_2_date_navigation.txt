## üéØ DATE NAVIGATION TASK

### Assess date navigation type
Look at the current page and identify what type of date navigation exists:
- **Individual dates**: Calendar, dropdown, date tabs, or clickable date found
- **Bulk navigation**: Week/month navigation buttons (Week, Month, etc.)
- **No date selection**: All dates shown on single page (scroll to see different day/dates)

### Test the available navigation method

**If individual dates are available:**
- Click 3 different dates (if available)
- **CRITICAL**: Test earliest, latest and current_date available dates to find date range boundaries
- **CRITICAL**: Note date format used by website and how dates are displayed
- Wait 2-3 seconds after each click to observe changes
- Note URL changes, content updates, or page indicators

**If bulk navigation is available (week/month):**
- Click "Previous Week" or "Previous Month" button once
- Click "Next Week" or "Next Month" button once  
- **CRITICAL**: Navigate to earliest and latest available periods to find overall date boundaries
- **CRITICAL**: Test how to find which week/month contains a specific date range
- Observe how content changes with bulk navigation
- Check if individual dates become clickable within each week/month view

**If static schedule (scroll-based):**
- Scroll down the page to see if different dates appear
- Scroll up to see if past dates are shown
- **CRITICAL**: Identify the complete date range available on the page (earliest to latest)
- **CRITICAL**: Document date format and how dates are organized for range processing
- Identify how dates are organized (by day sections, date headers, etc.)
- Note the date range visible on the single page

**If no date selection:**
- Confirm only current date is available
- **CRITICAL**: Document that date range navigation is not possible
- **CRITICAL**: Note if schedule shows multiple days (Mon/Tue/Wed) but no date selection
- Check page title, headers, or content for date information
- Look for any hidden or less obvious date navigation

### Capture date navigation
After testing the navigation method, capture the relevant element:
`capture_element_information(element_index, browser_session, capture_type="date_navigation")`

**Capture based on navigation type:**
- **Individual dates**: The date selection container (calendar, dropdown, tabs)
- **Bulk navigation**: The week/month navigation controls
- **Static schedule**: The main content area showing multiple dates
- **No date selection**: The date indicator or main schedule area

## üîÑ RETRY LOGIC
If the first navigation method doesn't work:
- Try alternative navigation if available
- Maximum 2 attempts before documenting current state

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS
Navigation testing successful when:
- Different dates show different content (individual/bulk navigation)
- Scrolling reveals different dates (static schedule)
- Current date is clearly identified (no date selection)

## üìù DOCUMENTATION FOR PLAYWRIGHT CODE GENERATION
Document the navigation pattern discovered:

**Individual dates**: How to select specific dates, date format, URL patterns, date range boundaries (min/max dates)
**Bulk navigation**: How week/month navigation works, individual date access within periods, how to find periods containing specific date ranges
**Static schedule**: How dates are organized on page, scrolling behavior, date identification method, complete date range available
**No date selection**: How current date is displayed, content structure, confirmation that date range navigation is impossible

Focus on information needed for automated crawling:
- How to access different dates programmatically
- What date ranges are available (earliest to latest dates)
- Most reliable selectors for automation
- Content structure for date-based extraction
- How to handle date range requests efficiently

## üéØ EFFICIENCY RULES
- Test navigation method only as much as needed to understand it
- Don't over-explore - focus on documenting the working pattern
- Capture the most representative element for code generation
- Document the simplest, most reliable approach found

Continue with intelligence gathering to enable comprehensive date-based crawling automation.
