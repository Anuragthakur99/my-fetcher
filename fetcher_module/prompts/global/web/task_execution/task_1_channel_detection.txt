## ‚è±Ô∏è TIMING & MATCHING RULES
- **Total time limit**: 120 seconds
- **Exact match search**: Maximum 30 seconds, then switch to approximate

- Determine website type:
  * **A**: Target channel already selected
  * **B**: Multiple channels available for selection
  * **C**: Only one channel exists on website

### STEP 2: Execute Strategy Based on Assessment

**STRATEGY A - Already Selected**
- Verify "{channel_name}" or similar is currently active
- Capture current channel indicator

- Try to navigate any other two more channel (if available)
- Verify navigation success and document how to navigate to any channel for playwright code generation (URL/content change/ etc)
- Capture main channel area
- `capture_element_information(element_index, browser_session, capture_type="channel_navigation")`

**STRATEGY C - Single Channel**
- Confirm only one channel exists
- Verify it reasonably relates to "{channel_name}"
