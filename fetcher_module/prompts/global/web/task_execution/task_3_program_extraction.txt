## üéØ PROGRAM EXTRACTION TASK

### Step 1: Identify program data presentation (30 seconds)
Look at the current page and identify how programs are shown:
- **Program listings**: Individual tv programs displayed on the page (most common)
- **Download options**: Files/exports available for tv program schedules (less common)
- **Multi-channel layout**: Programs for multiple channels exists on same page together
- **Single channel layout**: Programs for one channel only displayed at a time on the page

### Step 2: Test program access patterns (60 seconds)

**If program listings are visible:**
- **Channel identification**: If multi-channel page, identify how to distinguish target channel programs
- **Program interaction test**: Click on 3 different programs to understand what happens:
  - **Display-only**: No interaction (just visual display)
  - **Detail pages**: New page opens with more program info
  - **Popups/modals**: Overlay appears with additional details
  - **URL-based**: Check if programs have direct URLs for navigation

**If download options are available:**
- **Download scope**: Test 1-2 download links to understand file coverage (daily/weekly/monthly)
- **File accessibility**: Verify downloads works

### Step 3: Determine optimal strategy (30 seconds)
Based on exploration, identify the most efficient approach:
- **Listing + URL navigation**: Direct URL access to program details (fastest)
- **Listing + Click navigation**: Click-based access to program details
- **Listing only**: Programs are display-only, no additional details
- **Download files**: File-based program data access

### Step 4: Capture navigation pattern
`capture_element_information(element_index, browser_session, capture_type="program_extraction")`

**Capture priority:**
- **Multi-channel**: Capture channel-specific program container
- **Single channel**: Capture main program listing container
- **Download**: Capture download section container
- call `capture_element_information(element_index, browser_session, capture_type="program_extraction")`

## üîÑ RETRY LOGIC
If first approach doesn't work:
- Try alternative navigation method once
- Document what works and what doesn't

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS
Exploration successful when:
- Program access method is identified and tested
- Navigation pattern is documented
- Most efficient approach is determined

## üìù DOCUMENTATION FOR CODE GENERATION
Document the discovered patterns:

**Program Layout**: Single vs multi-channel, how programs are organized
**Access Method**: Display-only, clickable details, URL navigation, downloads
**Navigation Pattern**: Most efficient way to access all program information
**Channel Filtering**: How to identify target channel programs on the same page listing (if multi-channel)
**URL Optimization**: Whether direct URL navigation is available and faster

Focus on navigation patterns needed for automated crawling:
- How to identify and access programs programmatically
- Most efficient navigation method for the website structure
- Reliable selectors for program identification

## üéØ EFFICIENCY RULES
- Test only enough to understand the working navigation pattern
- Focus on the most efficient approach for automation
- Don't over-explore program details - focus on access patterns
- Document the simplest, most reliable navigation method

Continue with intelligence gathering to enable efficient program data collection.
